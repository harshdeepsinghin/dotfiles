## Instructions

- The prebuilt VM I am using is from `https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/kali-2023`.
- Then using the script it will setup VM for basic working.

## Usage

- Run the command `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harshdeepsinghin/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/UTM/kali-linux/setup.sh)`


## Battery Optimization
CPU Cores:
Set Kali to:
- 2 cores (ideal)
- Maximum 3 cores

RAM:
If you have:
- 8GB Mac → give Kali 2GB
- 16GB Mac → give Kali 4GB max
